I'm a data scientist at the LA County Department of Public Health helping maintain the [COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm) and it's associated data pipeline -

When I'm not working my dayjob I switch between studying for my Masters degree, lifting weights, and watching tv with my girlfriend and 3 dogs - :man_student: :weight_lifting: :dog2: :pig2: :dog2:

Years from now I would like to teach/tutor middle school and highschool after school programs. Being part of Regional Occupational Program (ROP) in highschool really helped shape my future and would like to pay it back - :teacher:
